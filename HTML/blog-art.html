      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Themes</h2>
      <p>
        I often make things which do not have that much meaning. I like things
        which are aesthetically pleasing and which appeals to cuteness.
      </p>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Research</h2>
      <p>
        I like aesthetic things which have a message. Like the image I saw of
        the animals which were represented as pixels in an image. Which
        represented how the animals are disappearing from our frame of
        reference. I really liked that link where it had the concious and
        subconcious thoughts which is highlighted when the cursor hovers over
        the text. The Internet We know is internet art about cookies and how the
        internet harvests your data.
      </p>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Brainstorming</h2>
      <p>
        What if I made a meme template which is based on internet culture or new
        internet memes or information - text is automated, commentary on gen z
        humour patterns - Maybe the meme template makes use of some buzz words
        for humour but this needs to be researched. - Maybe an internet game?
        Something simple like a game where you just need to jump over obstacles.
        - What happens if I have something serious and then use pop-ups for
        humour to take away from the seriousness of an article. - Data
        harvesting and how the birds work for the government - maybe something
        about cookies, happiness survey, login page which needs an email address
        to read something or do something.
      </p>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Technical constraints</h2>
      <p>
        I think it will be difficult to make all the ideas because they rely on
        information from the internet, and I’m not sure how to connect them.
        Additionally, I’m not sure how I can make those numbers be represented
        in pixels, or how to make the image more or less pixelated. I think the
        meme idea or the cookies idea would be much more easy to create because
        they rely on CSS only and I can make predetermined text.

      <h1 class="p-article-title">Rationale and Reflection</h1>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Description</h2>
      <p>
        My internet artwork is a text message chat between two friends. As a
        user hovers over the blurred out text, the message is revealed to them.
        This is to simulate the same feeling of receiving a text. The artwork
        will also have no footer to simulate the feeling of endlessness -
        because in the story, the people have texted so much that it cannot fit
        onto one page.
      </p>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Rationale</h2>
      <p>
        My artwork is a commentary on the discussion about friendships formed
        through online interactions. To me this is important because people are
        moving more towards using technology as an extension of themself and a
        way for them to form their sense of self. Additionally, I feel like
        there is a type of bond which can form even if all interactions are
        facilitated by a digital platform, and this bond is often overlooked or
        undervalued. My Artwork hopes to provide stimulation towards the
        discussion of online friendships.
